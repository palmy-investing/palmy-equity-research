- Sharing entity_classification.py; Can be useful if you are able to observe the data (i.e. RIAs by FINRA/SEC);

- Introduced a new classify_by_forms which is way more reliable than the ENTS class, especially when you have IDX data available
- That's the reason for uploading ParserIDX [which still misses some import, and support funcs to work on your end] [TODO]
